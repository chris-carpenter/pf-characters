# Race - [Gnome](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome/)
* **Ability Score Modifiers**: Gnomes are physically weak but surprisingly hardy, and their attitude makes them naturally agreeable. They gain +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, and –2 Strength.
* **Type**: Gnomes are Humanoid creatures with the gnome subtype.
* **Size**: Gnomes are Small creatures and thus gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a –1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.
* **Base Speed**: (Slow Speed) Gnomes have a base speed of 20 feet.
* **Languages**: Gnomes begin play speaking Common, Gnome, and Sylvan. Gnomes with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.
* **Keen Senses**: Gnomes receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. 
* **Academician**: Some gnomes are more academically inclined than their kin. Gnomes with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any single Knowledge skill. This racial trait replaces the obsessive racial trait.
* **Fey Fortitude**: Gnomes with this racial trait are infused with a connection to life. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saves to resist death effects. This replaces weapon familiarity.
* **Gift of Tongues**: Gnomes love languages and learning about those they meet. Gnomes with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, and they learn one additional language every time they put a rank in the Linguistics skill. This racial trait replaces defensive training and hatred.
* **Pyromaniac**: Gnomes with this racial trait are treated as one level higher when casting spells with the fire descriptor, using granted powers of the Fire domain, using the bloodline powers of the fire elemental bloodline or the revelations of the oracle’s flame mystery, and determining the damage of alchemist bombs that deal fire damage (this ability does not give gnomes early access to level-based powers; it only affects the powers they could use without this ability). Gnomes with Charisma scores of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—dancing lights, flare, prestidigitation, produce flame. The caster level for these effects is equal to the gnome’s level; the DCs are Charisma-based. This racial trait replaces gnome magic and illusion resistance.
# Traits
* **Frontier Healer**: You make your way in life by putting people back together after the rigors of the world take their toll—brewing herbal remedies, setting broken bones, and treating diseases. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Heal and Knowledge (nature) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Any time you restore hit points using the Heal skill or a cure spell (but not with channeled energy, lay on hands, or a magic device such as a potion or wand), you restore 1 additional hit point, plus 1 for every 2 class levels you have beyond 1st.
* **[Without a Past](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/without-a-past/)**: *Linguistics*. You earn +1 trait bonus to Bluff and Linguistics when used to forge documents, and choose one as a class skill.

## Revelation
* **[Elemental Linguist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/archetypes/paizo-oracle-archetypes/elementalist-oracle) (Su)**: At 1st level, you gain a bonus language of your choice from the following list: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you may choose another language from this list.
* **[Nature’s Whispers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/mysteries/paizo-oracle-mysteries/nature/) (Ex)**: You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.
