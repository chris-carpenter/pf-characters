# Pathfinder Characters
* [Teagon](characters/teagon) - is a gnome nature oracle(elementalist). Teagon wanted to "experiment" with a recipe found in the university forbidden 
library, but after being strictly told to not experiment indoors decided to use the green space next to the university. 
The "green space" was in fact the shrine garden of the neighboring temple. Temple to whom you might ask? Teagan 
certainly didn't know and neither shall you.
