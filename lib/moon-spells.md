###Moon Lust
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 143)

[Illusion](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/illusion/) ([Pattern](https://dndtools.net/spells/sub-schools/pattern/)) [[Mind-Affecting](https://dndtools.net/spells/descriptors/mind-affecting/)]\
**Level**: Cleric 1,\
**Components**: V, S, DF,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)\
**Target**: One living creature\
**Duration**: 1 round/level\
**Saving Throw**: Will partial\
**Spell Resistance**: Yes

Forcefully presenting a silver ingot in your hand, you extol the virtues of the moon's beauty in a language both 
beautiful and dead. The words of your loving declaration call forth a silver-white glow around your target that swiftly 
fades.
 
This spell instills in the target an obsessive fascination with the moon. If the target fails its save, it fixates on 
the moon, staring at the moon or imagining it in its mind, and is considered fascinated for the duration of the spell.

If the saving throw is successful, the subject is instead dazzled for the duration of the spell.
 
Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell.
 
_Focus_: A silver ingot worth 5 gp.

###Moonbeam
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 144)

[Evocation](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/evocation/)\
**Level**: Moon 2,\
**Components**: V, S, M, DF,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: 30 ft.\
**Area**: Cone-shaped emanation\
**Duration**: 1 minute/level (D)\
**Saving Throw**: None or Will negates; see text\
**Spell Resistance**: No

As you complete this spell, a swath of pale moonlight springs from your hand.
 
On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone of light points.
 
Light from a moonbeam spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in 
humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope
 in animal form can change out of it on the creature's next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is 
 still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against 
 moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours.
 
Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam.
 
_Arcane Material Component_: A pinch of white powder.
###Moon Blade
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 143)

[Evocation](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/evocation/)\
**Level**: Moon 3,\
**Components**: V, S, M, DF,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: 0 ft.\
**Effect**: A swordlike beam\
**Duration**: 1 minute/level (D)\
**Saving Throw**: None\
**Spell Resistance**: Yes

A 3-foot-long blazing beam of moonlight springs forth from your hand.
 
You call a swordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with 
proficiency. However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of 
sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus.
 
Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but 
dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. 
Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of 
damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow. The blade is immaterial, and your Strength modifier 
does not apply to the damage.
 
_Arcane Material Component_: A small candy made with wintergreen oil.

###Moon Bolt
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 143)

[Evocation](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/evocation/)\
**Level**: Cleric 4, Druid 4,\
**Components**: V, S,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)\
**Target**: One living or undead creature, or two living or undead creatures that are no more than 15 ft. apart; see text\
**Duration**: Instantaneous\
**Saving Throw**: Fortitude half (living target) or Will negates (undead target)\
**Spell Resistance**: Yes\

Picturing a full moon in your mind you call upon the cyclical energies of the celestial body. You create a bolt of 
shimmering moonlight that streaks from your outstretched hand.
 
A moon bolt strikes unerringly against any living or undead creature in range.
 
A living creature struck by a moon bolt takes 1d4 points of Strength damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d4). If 
the subject makes a successful Fortitude saving throw, the Strength damage is halved.\
An undead creature struck by a moon bolt must make a Will save or fall helpless for 1d4 rounds, after which time it is 
no longer helpless and can stand upright, but it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Will saving throws for the next 
minute.

###Moon Path
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 143)

[Evocation](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/evocation/) [Force]\
**Level**: Moon 5,\
**Components**: V, S, M, DF,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)\
**Effect**: A variable-width, glowing white stair or bridge of translucent force up to 15 ft./level long; see text\
**Duration**: 1 minute/level (D)\
**Saving Throw**: None; see text\
**Spell Resistance**: No

As you cast this spell, pure, pale moonlight shapes itself into a stair or bridge, as you desire.
 
Moon path allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing 
white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the 
width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in 
midair.
 
At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on 
or moving along the moon path. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 
1st-level spell sanctuary except that the save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks 
breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they 
have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.
 
Unlike a wall of force, a moon path can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no 
supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving
 the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from 
 a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath 
 weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.
  It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path.
 
A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or
 creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or 
 descend any more sharply than 45 degrees.
 
_Arcane Material Component_: A white handkerchief.

###Moonfire
([Spell Compendium](https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/spell-compendium--86/), p. 144)
 
[Evocation](https://dndtools.net/spells/schools/evocation/) [Light]\
**Level**: Moon 9,\
**Components**: V, S, DF,\
**Casting Time**: 1 standard action\
**Range**: 60 ft.\
**Area**: Cone-shaped burst and coneshaped emanation; see text\
**Duration**: Instantaneous and 1 round/level; see text\
**Saving Throw**: Reflex half and Will negates; see text\
**Spell Resistance**: Yes
 
A cone of fiery white moonlight springs from your hand.
 
Living creatures in the area of a moonfire spell feel an unnatural chill and take 1d8 points of damage per two caster 
levels (maximum 10d8). Undead and shapechangers take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). This 
application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage.
 
All magical auras within the cone glow with a faint blue light for 1 round per caster level. Disguised, shapechanged, or
 polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately
 return to their normal forms. Even if the save succeeds, they remain covered in ghostly white outlines that show their
 true forms for 1 round per caster level.
 
The entire area covered by the cone glows silver-white for 1 round per caster level. This radiance is as bright as the 
light of a full moon and negates electricity damage for 1 round per caster level unless the item or creature generating 
the electricity effect makes a caster level check (1d20 + item's caster level or creature's caster level) against a DC 
equal to 10 + your caster level. If an electricity effect is generated outside the glowing cone, the cone blocks the 
electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect succeeds on a caster level check. If an electricity effect 
is generated inside the glowing cone, the cone negates the electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect 
succeeds on a caster level check.
