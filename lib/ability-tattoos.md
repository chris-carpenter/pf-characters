# Ability Tattoos
Ability Tattoos are tattoos that use magical inks in specific runic patterns to enhance the wearers body and mind. Tattoos can be designed to benefit the body or the mind. But multiple tattoos of body or mind interfere with one another and so must be designed as one tattoo. Tattoos follow the normal cost guidelines for ability bonus magical items.

This is meant to be used in place of stat headbands and belts.

TLDR: Effectively each character gets 2 additional magic item slots for ability score items. One for mental and one for body.
